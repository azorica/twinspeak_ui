## Development

### Component Development

Components are organized following atomic design principles:

- **Atoms**: Basic building blocks (buttons, inputs, etc.)
- **Molecules**: Groups of atoms (forms, cards, etc.)
- **Organisms**: Complex UI sections (headers, footers, etc.)
- **Templates**: Page layouts

### Styling

The application uses Vuetify for styling with a custom theme configuration. Theme settings can be modified in `styles/themeConfig.ts`.

### State Management

Pinia is used for state management. Stores are located in the `stores` directory.
